# 📌 FixedList – A Generic Collection with Fixed Capacity  

Welcome to **FixedList**! 🚀 This project is a **generic collection** designed to store a limited number of elements efficiently while maintaining type safety. Whether you're dealing with numbers, dates, strings, or booleans, **FixedList** ensures that your collection stays within its predefined capacity.  

## 🎯 Key Features  

✅ Supports **multiple data types** – Integers, Strings, Doubles, Dates, and Booleans.  
✅ **Fixed capacity** ensures that lists never exceed their predefined limits.  
✅ **Prevents accidental overflow** by restricting additional elements beyond capacity.  
✅ **Exception handling** for attempts to add more elements than allowed.  
✅ **Type-safe generic class** for enhanced usability and efficiency.

## 🚀 How It Works  

Imagine a **container** that can only hold a certain number of items – no more, no less. **FixedList** ensures that your collection **never exceeds its capacity**, making it ideal for scenarios where controlled storage is required.  

It supports:  

- **Numbers:** Store **integers and doubles** with precision.  
- **Dates:** Keep track of important events using **LocalDate**.  
- **Strings:** Manage names and other **text-based data** efficiently.  
- **Booleans:** Store **true/false** values for logical operations.  

## 🔥 Why Use This Project?  

💡 **Prevents accidental data overflows** with controlled storage limits.  
💡 **Improves memory efficiency** by avoiding unnecessary memory allocation.  
💡 **Provides a reusable generic solution** for multiple data types.  
💡 **Ensures type safety** and easy integration into Java applications.  

## ⚙️ How to Use  

1. **Clone the repository** or download the project files.  
2. **Compile and run** `Main.java` using a Java compiler.  
3. **Create a FixedList** with your desired type and capacity.  
4. **Add elements** within the allowed limit.  
5. **Handle exceptions** when exceeding capacity.  

## 🚀 Future Improvements  

🔹 Implement **custom error messages** for different data types.  
🔹 Add **support for resizing the list dynamically** if needed.  
🔹 Develop a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for better visualization.  
🔹 Integrate **database storage** to persist collections.
